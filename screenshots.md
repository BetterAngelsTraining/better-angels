                <h2>Find your friends</h2>
                <p>Buoy&rsquo;s real-time map updates as you move. You can recognize your friends by their Gravatars. Clicking on their gravatar gives you one-click access to turn-by-turn directions, a phone call, or any other feature (if your friend enables it in their profile).</p>

                <h2>Integrated chat</h2>
                <p>Every time you send an alert, Buoy creates a secure, private chat room that all responders can use. This lets you communicate with anyone who answers your alert, but also lets responders coordinate with one another regarding how best to help you. Buoy comes with a built-in chat system (pictured), and can be configured to use other chat systems with the touch of a button. (We hope to add videoconferencing soon. If you can help, join <a href="https://github.com/betterangels/better-angels/issues/165">the conversation on our issue tracker</a>!)</p>

                <h2>Built for mobile</h2>
                <p>Send an alert in one click. If you are in a really severe situation, <em>you can put your phone back in your pocket</em> and deal with the situation at hand. Responders will still be able to find you even if you never again touch Buoy. One tap is all it takes to get help from the people you trust most.</p>
